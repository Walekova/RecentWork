    "# Question 6: Document Classification Task Overview.\n",

In this question we'll use the example from Table 13.1 (reproduced below) to 'train' an unsmoothed Multinomial Naive Bayes model and classify a test document by hand.\n",

    "* __a) short response:__ Equation 13.3 in Manning, Raghavan and Shutze shows how a Multinomial Naive Bayes model classifies a document. It predicts the class, $c$, for which the estimated conditional probability of the class given the document's contents,  $\\hat{P}(c|d)$, is greatest. In this equation what two pieces of information are required to calculate  $\\hat{P}(c|d)$? Your answer should include both mathematical notatation and verbal explanation.\n",

In plain English, explain what  $\\hat{P}(c)$ and   $\\hat{P}(t_{k} | c)$ mean in the context of this data. How will we would estimate these values from a training corpus?

Calculate the class priors and the conditional probabilities for an __unsmoothed__ Multinomial Naive Bayes model trained on this data. Show the calculations that lead to your result using markdown and $\\LaTeX$ in the space provided or by embedding an image of your hand written work.

    "In the next two questions you'll write code to parallelize the Naive Bayes calculations that you performed above. We'll do this in two phases: one MapReduce job to perform training and a second MapReduce to perform inference. While in practice we'd need to train a model before we can use it to classify documents, for learning purposes we're going to develop our code in the opposite order. By first focusing on the pieces of information/format we need to perform the classification (inference) task you should find it easier to develop a solid implementation for training phase when you get to question 8 below. In both of these questions we'll continue to use the Chinese example corpus from the textbook to help us test our MapReduce code as we develop it. Below we've reproduced the corpus, test set and model in text format that matches the Enron data.\n",

This text file represents a Naive Bayes model trained (with Laplace +1 smoothing) on the example corpus. What are the 'keys' and 'values' in this file? Which record means something slightly different than the rest? The value field of each record includes two numbers which will be helpful for debugging but which we don't actually need to perform inference -- what are they? [`HINT`: _This file represents the model from Example 13.1 in the textbook, if you're having trouble getting oriented try comparing our file to the numbers in that example._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ When performing Naive Bayes in practice instead of multiplying the probabilities (as in equation 13.3) we add their logs (as in equation 13.4). Why do we choose to work with log probabilities? If we had an unsmoothed model, what potential error could arise from this transformation?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ Documents 6 and 8 in the test set include a word that did not appear in the training corpus (and as a result does not appear in the model). What should we do at inference time when we need a class conditional probability for this word?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ The goal of our MapReduce job is to stream over the test set and classify each document by peforming the calculation from equation 13.4. To do this we'll load the model file (which contains the probabilities for equation 13.4) into memory on the nodes where we do our mapping. This is called an in-memory join. Does loading a model 'state' like this depart from the functional programming principles? Explain why or why not.

Run the provided unit tests to confirm that your script works as expected then write a Hadoop streaming job to classify the Chinese example test set. [`HINT 1:` _you shouldn't need a reducer for this one._ `HINT 2:` _Don't forget to add the model file to the_ `-files` _parameter in your Hadoop streaming job so that it gets shipped to the mapper nodes where it will be accessed by your script._]\n",

    "* __f) short response:__ In our test example and in the Enron data set we have fairly short documents. Since these fit fine in memory on a mapper node we didn't need a reducer and could just do all of our calculations in the mapper. However with much longer documents (eg. books) we might want a higher level of parallelization -- for example we might want to process parts of a document on different nodes. In this hypothetical scenario how would our algorithm design change? What could the mappers still do? What key-value structure would they emit? What would the reducers have to do as a last step?"

    "In Question 7 we used a model that we had trained by hand. Next we'll develop the code to do that same training in parallel, making it suitable for use with larger corpora (like the Enron emails). The end result of the MapReduce job you write in this question should be a model text file that looks just like the example (`NBmodel.txt`) that we created by hand above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refresh your memory about the training process take a look at  `6a` and `6b` where you described the pieces of information you'll need to collect in order to encode a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. We now want to retrieve those pieces of information while streaming over a corpus. The bulk of the task will be very similar to the word counting excercises you've already done but you may want to consider a slightly different key-value record structure to efficiently tally counts for each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging (interesting?) design question will be how to retrieve the totals (# of documents and # of words in documents for each class). Of course, counting these numbers is easy. The hard part is the timing: you'll need to make sure you have the counts totalled up _before_ you start estimating the class conditional probabilities for each word. It would be best (i.e. most scalable) if we could find a way to do this tallying without storing the whole vocabulary in memory... Use an appropriate MapReduce design pattern to implement this efficiently! \n",

    "* __a) make a plan:__  Fill in the docstrings for __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ to appropriately reflect the format that each script will input/output. [`HINT:` _the input files_ (`enronemail_1h.txt` & `chineseTrain.txt`) _have a prespecified format and your output file should match_ `NBmodel.txt` _so you really only have to decide on an internal format for Hadoop_].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) implement it:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ so that together they train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model __with no smoothing__. Make sure your end result is formatted correctly (see note above). Test your scripts independently and together (using `chineseTrain.txt` or test input of your own devising). When you are satisfied with your Python code design and run a Hadoop streaming command to run your job in parallel on the __chineseTrain.txt__. Confirm that your trained model matches your hand calculations from Question 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ We saw in Question 6 that adding Laplace +1 smoothing makes our classifications less sensitve to rare words. However implementing this technique requires access to one additional piece of information that we had not previously used in our Naive Bayes training. What is that extra piece of information? [`HINT:` see equation 13.7 in Manning, Raghavan and Schutze].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ There are a couple of approaches that we could take to handle the extra piece of information you identified in `c`: 1) if we knew this extra information beforehand, we could provide it to our reducer as a configurable parameter for the vocab size dynamically (_where would we get it in the first place?_). Or 2) we could compute it in the reducer without storing any bulky information in memory but then we'd need some postprocessing or a second MapReduce job to complete the calculation (_why?_). Breifly explain what is non-ideal about each of these options. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code + short response:__ Choose one of the 2 options above. State your choice & reasoning in the space below then use that strategy to complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer_smooth.py`__. Test this alternate reducer then write and run a Hadoop streaming job to train an MNB model with smoothing on the Chinese example. Your results should match the model that we provided for you above (and the calculations in the textbook example). __IMPORTANT NOTE:__ For full credit on this question, your code must work with multiple reducers. \n",

    "* __a) train/test split:__ Run the provided code to split our Enron file into a training set and testing set then load them into HDFS. [`NOTE:` _Make sure you re calculate the vocab size for just the training set!_]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) train 2 models:__ Write Hadoop Streaming jobs to train MNB Models on the training set with and without smoothing. Save your models to local files at __`NaiveBayes/Unsmoothed/NBmodel.txt`__ and __`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.txt`__. [`NOTE:` _This naming is important because we wrote our classification task so that it expects a file of that name... if this inelegance frustrates you there is an alternative that would involve a few adjustments to your code [read more about it here](http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-11-23)._] Finally run the checks that we provide to confirm that your results are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Recall that we designed our classification job with just a mapper. An efficient way to report the performance of our models would be to simply add a reducer phase to this job and compute precision and recall right there. Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/evaluation_reducer.py`__ and then write Hadoop jobs to evaluate your two models on the test set. Report their performance side by side. [`NOTE:` if you need a refresher on precision, recall and F1-score [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) is a good resource.]\n",

    "* __a) code + short response:__ Let's look at the top ten words with the highest conditional probability in `Spam` and in `Ham`. We'll do this by writing a Hadoop job that sorts the model file (`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.py`). Normally we'd have to run two jobs -- one that sorts on $P(word|ham)$ and another that sorts on $P(word|spam)$. However if we slighly modify the data format in the model file then we can get the top words in each class with just one job. We've written a mapper that will do just this for you. Read through __`NaiveBayes/model_sort_mapper.py`__ and then briefly explain how this mapper will allow us to partition and sort our model file. Write a Hadoop job that uses our mapper and `/bin/cat` for a reducer to partition and sort. Print out the top 10 words in each class (where 'top' == highest conditional probability).[`HINT:` _this should remind you a lot of what we did in Question 6._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ What do you notice about the 'top words' we printed in `a`? How would increasing the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the probabilities for the top words that you identified for 'a'. How would they affect the probabilities of words that occur much more in one class than another? In summary, how does the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the bias and the variance of our model. [`NOTE:` _you do not need to code anything for this task, but if you are struggling with it you could try changing 'k' and see what happens to the test set. We don't recommend doing this exploration with the Enron data because it will be harder to see the impact with such a big vocabulary_]"
