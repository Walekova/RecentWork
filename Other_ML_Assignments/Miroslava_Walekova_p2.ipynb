    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively dense (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively sparse (represented as a bag-of-words). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "QUESTION: Why doesn't k-Nearest Neighbors work well for this problem?\n",

    "ANSWER: Contributing factors:\n",
    "1. Small sample size is likely to be one of the reasons for Naive Bayes to outperform Logistic Regression. \n",
    "2. Naive Bayes assumes independence of each feature, while Logistic regression looks for a linear relationship between features.\n",

    "### Part 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For several L1 regularization strengths ...<br/>\n",
    "* Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight.  Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary and **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l1\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L1 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001)."
